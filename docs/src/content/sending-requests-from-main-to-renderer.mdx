# Sending requests from main to renderer

Sometimes we might want to send an explicit request from main to renderer, either to instruct the renderer to do something or to retrieve some data from the renderer.

Let's say we want the main process to be able to get the HTML of the current page and to toggle a class on the body element.

In order to do that, we will need to define two message types and then define their handlers.

```ts filename="message-types.ts"
import { defineBridgeMessage } from "superbridge";

/**
 * $toggleBodyClass takes a class name and returns a boolean value indicating 
 * whether the class is currently on the body element.
 */
export const $toggleBodyClass = defineBridgeMessage<string, boolean>("$toggleBodyClass");

/**
 * $getPageHtml takes no input and returns the HTML of the current page.
 */
export const $getPageHtml = defineBridgeMessage<void, string>("$getPageHtml");
```

The `defineBridgeMessage` function accepts two type arguments: the input it takes and the output it produces.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> Messages need to be defined in a file that will be imported by both main and renderer.

Now, we need to tell the renderer how to handle these messages.

```ts filename="renderer.ts"
import { $toggleBodyClass, $getPageHtml } from "./message-types";
import { superbridge } from "superbridge";

superbridge.handle($toggleBodyClass, (className) => {
  document.body.classList.toggle(className);

  return document.body.classList.contains(className);
});

superbridge.handle($getPageHtml, () => {
  return document.body.innerHTML;
});
```

Now, on the main side, we can send these messages.

```ts filename="main.ts"
import { $toggleBodyClass, $getPageHtml } from "./message-types";
import { superbridge } from "superbridge";

superbridge.send($toggleBodyClass, "dark");

const html = await superbridge.send($getPageHtml);
console.log(html);
```

> [!NOTE]
> 
> If on the renderer side you only handle messages but never use the client from `superbridge/client`, somewhere early in your renderer code, add:
> 
> ```ts
> import "superbridge/client";
> ```
> 
> This will ensure that `superbridge` is properly initialized and able to connect to the main process.
>
> TLDR: `superbridge/client` must be imported at least once in your renderer code, before you send or handle any messages.

## Two-way communication

The pattern above is symmetric. Either side of the bridge can send messages or handle them.

It is possible for both sides to send and handle messages to each other.

As with everything else, those messages can send data of any type supported by the client, including callback functions.
